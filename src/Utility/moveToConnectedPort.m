function moveToConnectedPort(block, varargin)
% MOVETOPORT Move a block to the right/left of the block it is connected to,
%   and align it with the port it is connected to. If it is connected to more
%   than one block, use the first port. If it is connected to both a source and
%   destination block, move to the source.
%
%   This function is best used for automatically moving blocks with a single
%   connection, such as a terminator or goto to its source.
%
%   Note: Trigger Ports are not yet supported.
%
%   Inputs:
%       block       Handle of the block to be moved.
%       varargin{1} Block offset in pixels.

%   Outputs:
%       N/A
