# RESIZE_BLOCK Enables or disables the resizing of Goto/From block length
# to a specific size. This can be done in order to keep all Goto/Froms a
# consistent size, or to accommodate the block's tag. If enabled, new
# Goto/From blocks will be resized, whether it be dynamically or statically.
# The STATIC_RESIZE configuration parameter selects the resizing scheme to
# use. If disabled, new Goto/From blocks will not change from the original
# block length.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#    1      to enable resizing of Goto/From block length
#    0      to disable resizing of Goto/From block length
#
resize_block: 1

# STATIC_RESIZE Enables or disables the ability to resize Goto/From block
# length to a fixed value. If enabled, new Goto/From blocks will be resized
# to a static value, given by STATIC_LENGTH. If disabled, new Goto/From
# blocks will be resized dynamically based on the length of its tag. This
# parameter is used only when RESIZE_BLOCK is enabled.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#    1      to select a static resizing scheme for Goto/From block length
#    0      to select a dynamic resizing scheme for Goto/From block length
#
static_resize: 0

# STATIC_LENGTH The number of pixels that Goto/From blocks are resized to
# lengthwise, when STATIC_RESIZE is enabled.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#    1 - 30000      the static length of a Goto/From block, in pixels
#
static_length: 140

# PX_PER_LETTER The number of pixels to allocate per letter of a Goto/From
# tag, that the block will be resized to. This parameter is used when
# STATIC_RESIZE is disabled (i.e., for the dynamic resizing scheme).
# Note that if the new size of the tag is less than the original default
# size of the block, it will not be resized to be smaller than this value.
#
# The dynamic length of a Goto/From block is determined by:
#   length(gotoTag) * PX_PER_LETTER;
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#    1 - 100        the static length of a Goto/From block, in pixels
#
px_per_letter: 9

# BLOCK_OFFSET The distance in pixels between Goto/From blocks and the
# blocks that they are connected to.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#    0 - 30000      the static distance between a Goto/From block and its
#                   connected block, in pixels
#
block_offset: 35

# LINE_ROUTING Enables or disables 'autorouting' when adding new lines.
# Enabling this will route lines around obstructing blocks, while disabling
# it will draw lines directly. This can lead to diagonal lines.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#    1      to route lines around blocks
#    0      to route lines with diagonal lines
#
line_routing: 1

# FROM_SIGNAL_NAMING Enables or disables the naming of signal names out of new
# From block(s) to match the input signal of the associated Goto block.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#    1      to name signals out of From block(s)
#    0      to leave signal name empty
#
from_signal_naming: 0

# FROM_SIGNAL_PROPAGATION Enables or disables the propagation of the Goto
# input signal through its new From block(s). Simulation may be necessary to
# populate the signal names.
#
# Acceptable parameter values are:
#    1      to propagate signals through From block(s)
#    0      to not propagate signals through From block(s)
#
from_signal_propagation: 0
